        <p class = "about-me-text">
        I just completed Flatiron School\’s data science program with the aim of working with data in the education and/or social justice arena. I am a former English teacher and cook and I want to bring some of my on the ground insight working in populations with large percentages of English Language Learners to find new ways of optimizing services and learning outcomes. I\’m particularly interested in making data digestible to a wide audience in the same ways that a good teacher can break down a difficult concept. I’m currently working on developing a front end to a sentiment classifier that takes in parent and student comments from a discussion board and will give you back a score as to how a community feels about their school as well as a list of frequent topics.

    <!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
    <p class="project-1-summary"><strong>SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT TERRY STOPS: </strong><br>This project seeks to investigate Terry Stop data from the Seattle Police Department's Open Data government program from the years 2015 to 2019. Terry Stops derive their origin from the Supreme Court case Terry v. Ohio in which a police officer stopped John Terry on the street, along with two other men, and found two firearms on the men. The officer testified that he used his years of experience as a patrolling officer to judge the mens' reactions which led him to stop them. The Supreme Court ruled that using "probable cause", an officer can stop and frisk a civilian on the street. Using Seattle's Terry Stop data for 28,530 stops I intend to develop an analysis using binary classification to predict whether or not a stop ends in arrest, and to analyze the data in search of any bias when conducting stops and subsequent arrests.<br><br><img src="images/seattle_pd_badge.png" style="height: 40%" style="width: 40%" /></p>
